🥗 EatWise AI — Your AI Food Co-Pilot

An AI food co-pilot that doesn't just explain ingredients — it explains decisions.

EatWise AI is an intelligent food analysis application that scans any food item — packaged products, raw ingredients, or fully cooked meals — and delivers a clear, human-readable verdict on whether it's safe and healthy to consume. Built at a hackathon by Team Just a Bot.

✨ Features
🔍 Smart Food Scanning

Scan any food — packaged items, raw produce, or cooked meals — via camera or image upload
Ask a question before scanning (e.g. "Is this safe for a diabetic?") and get a context-aware response
Powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash with vision-to-text capabilities

📊 Comprehensive Health Analysis

Health Score — A score out of 10 indicating overall healthiness
Freshness & Risk Level — Immediate assessment of whether the food is fresh and safe to eat
Confidence Meter — Transparent display of how confident the AI is in its results; never pretends certainty
Human Insight — Translates complex chemical ingredient names into plain English, explaining real-world effects, safe consumption quantities, and frequency guidelines

⚠️ Safety & Allergy Intelligence

Harmful Content Flagging — Highlights specific ingredients that are dangerous for particular diseases, allergies, or dietary conditions
Adversarial Reasoning — Reasons over uncertain or partial data, explains edge cases, and handles ambiguous scenarios rather than making blind assumptions
